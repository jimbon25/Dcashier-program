# FRONTEND_URL=https://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Netlify)
```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (or connect GitHub repo)
# Set environment variable:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend-url
```
